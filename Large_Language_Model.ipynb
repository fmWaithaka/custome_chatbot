            "\n",
            "Quality Education, Research, and Technology Transfer is core at Dedan Kimathi University. It is as a result of this that the University has a trade mark of locally produced coffee from the University farm, yogurt in three different flavors (coffee, strawberry, and vanilla) as well as Chia and Bamboo yogurt. Training of students backed by practical sessions in the Food Technology Workshops gave birth to these products. The Director IFBT, Dr. Eddy Owaga, says that the Institute looks forward to maintaining the best quality in all the products. The next plan is to develop other value-added products from non-conventional fruits and vegetables towards satisfying the demand for natural healthy foods. The institute will later diversify to meat products particularly sausage from the pork reared at DeKUT farm. Our students from the institute of food and bioresources technology are involved in such processes enhancing what they learn in class.\n",
            "\n",
            "### The University, in 2015, established an innovation and incubation centre (DeHUB) aimed at inspiring innovation and entrepreneurship by way of transforming innovative ideas emanating from within and outside DeKUT community into products, processes, and services for commercial exploitation. Students taking different courses are mentored from this centre into creating enterprises and becoming their brands by using what they learn in class as their base. That way, we do not just graduate job seekers but job creators and contributors to national development. So far, several projects from students have been incubated and some are at the commercial level. With the science park construction at the University underway, this is just the tip of the iceberg.\n",

            "\n",
            "Rapid prototyping (RP) has been an ongoing research among M.Sc. Advanced Manufacturing & Automation Engineering students at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (DeKUT). RP is an emerging collection of materials processing technologies and business practices, which together shorten product development cycles. RP technologies are frequently used towards the beginning of the product development lifecycle to create prototypes or parts used to test and verify designs before full-blown production begins. RP utilizes a number of different additive manufacturing methods such as 3D Printing, Stereolithography, Selective Laser Sintering, Fused Deposition Modeling, etc., to create real objects from a CAD file. This venture will inspire technological growth in the University and the Nation by enhancing engineering skills among the students. This will help bridge the gap between the Institutions of higher learning and Industries.\n",

            "### Another venture is the introduction of Siemens Mechatronic Systems Certification Program (SMSCP)\n",
            "\n",
            "Manufacturing, packaging, and other systems are becoming more complex and pervasive, and more knowledge is required to design, operate, and maintain them than ever before. Complex mechatronic systems are the nexus of mechanical, electrical, and computerized technologies. There is a growing need for qualified people with up‑to‑date knowledge of integrated mechatronic systems. A world leader in mechatronic engineering, SIEMENS, has responded to this need by creating an industry certification program that will help students, workers, industries, teachers, and institutions. Siemens Technik Akademie administrates the program and works with partner institutions worldwide to implement the program. SMSCP’s technical content focuses on key industrial skill areas, such as electrical components, sensors, motor controls, PLCs, hydraulics, and pneumatics. In addition to teaching the technical knowledge, SMSCP stresses troubleshooting and system-based technical thinking via hands-on training. This technical training, paired with our engineering degree programs, will create well-grounded workers that can easily meet the challenges of high tech and advanced manufacturing industries. Dedan Kimathi University of technology has partnered with Siemens, as the first in Africa, to enhance her training in Mechatronic Engineering by offering this certification. A DeKUT Siemens Training and Certification Centre was established and is now an accredited centre by EBK for Continuous Professional Development of practicing engineers in the industry.\n",

International exchanges are life-changing experiences gained by students. This makes such programs critical to the institution’s internationalization strategy. To date, a number of DeKUT students have taken part in assignments inside leading laboratories and manufacturing facilities around the world which have had a profound effect on the technical abilities of the students. In addition, living in a foreign country for two or three months at such an early age in their careers gives students invaluable insights and offers them new lenses through which to look at the world. We have signed memoranda of understanding with various universities globally for the exchange of students. These include the International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience (IAESTE) and the Association for the International Exchange of Students in Economics and Commerce (AIESEC). Through these mechanisms, DeKUT has been able to send and receive students from different parts of the world which has not only enhanced the diversity of the university student population but also enabled DeKUT students to gain valuable international work experience.\n",
